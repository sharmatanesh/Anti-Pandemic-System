"# Anti Pandemic Sysetm"
<h3>Introduction</h3>

When a new pandemic hits, diagnosing individuals is challenging. Testing on a large scale is difficult and tests are likely to be expensive, especially in the beginning. Anyone who has any symptoms of COVID-19 is likely to be very concerned that they have contracted the disease, even if the same symptoms are indicative of many other, potentially milder diseases too.

Instead of taking medical samples from each patient and waiting for slow, expensive lab reports to come back, a simpler, faster, and cheaper test (even if itâ€™s less accurate) would be useful in gathering data on a larger scale. This data will be taken and given to the Machine Learning model which will identifiy the person is suffering from covid 19 or not. 

The information will be shared with the nearby health organization also the users who are nearby to the victim will be informed by using msg. The system will monitor the person who is Corona positive and the person who have came in contact with patient. It is useful in pandemic but when it's over it can also be very useful for other sort of spreading diseases in future. After pandemic when it's all back to normal there lies actual problem for tracking patient at that point out system can be useful.
